# BUMS - Bilkent University Enhanced Mentorship System

A modern, responsive website showcasing the Bilkent University Enhanced Mentorship System (BUMS) project concept.

## Overview

BUMS is a centralized, mobile-first, smart-matching application designed to connect Bilkent University students with alumni for targeted, low-commitment Micro-Mentoring sessions (15-minutes). The platform addresses the decentralized and informal nature of Bilkent's current mentorship resources by providing proactive, personalized, and scalable support.

## Features

- **Modern, Responsive Design**: Fully responsive website that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Smooth Navigation**: Sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling to sections
- **Interactive Elements**: Animated cards and sections that fade in on scroll
- **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **Clean UI/UX**: Modern design with beautiful color scheme and typography
